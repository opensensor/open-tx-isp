# PRD: Finish T31 ISP Image Tuning

## Objective

Finish the image-tuning work for the open-source T31 ISP driver so that live output is acceptably close to the OEM driver in color, demosaic quality, denoise behavior, and mode switching, while preserving compatibility with `libimp.so`.

## Problem Statement

The project is no longer blocked on basic stream bring-up. Video streams, but image quality is still not production-ready. The current failure mode is severe false-color / green-magenta blobbing, which indicates the raw-to-color pipeline is still not behaviorally equivalent to the OEM driver.

This PRD turns the current reverse-engineering findings into a finish plan rather than continuing ad-hoc debugging.

## Goals

- Achieve stable, repeatable, visually correct color output in normal streaming
- Match OEM behavior closely enough that `libimp.so` tuning and runtime controls behave as expected
- Replace major synthetic/default tuning content with OEM-derived or OEM-shaped data
- Establish a repeatable validation workflow for day, night, and WDR modes

## Non-Goals

- Perfect mathematical equivalence for every internal register before visible parity is reached
- New user-facing features unrelated to OEM parity
- Retuning the pipeline from scratch without using OEM evidence

## Current State Summary

### What works

- Driver/module loads
- Core MMIO mapping and large ISP window mapping are in place
- Dual IRQ model (`isp-m0` / `isp-w02`) is understood and implemented
- Subdevice graph and stream control are operational enough for live video
- Tuning node exists and major blocks initialize

### What is still broken

- Current live image shows strong false-color blob artifacts
- Some ISP blocks still depend on synthetic/default parameter banks
- Several modules are structurally present but not fully OEM-calibrated

### Most important current historical finding

- `f37c28868810f760002b00e0a00707569b64bbdb` is the last known “crisp image” checkpoint
- The next relevant regression point was expansion of the enabled processing-block whitelist
- Under the current masked logic, the effective crisp-image block set is `0xDD04`

That means the project now has a concrete historical anchor for “good enough to compare against,” even if full parity was not yet achieved.

## High-Confidence Findings Already Established

### 1. Basic hardware path and ownership issues were real blockers

Resolved or understood areas include:

- ISP core mapping must cover the large OEM register space (`0x90000` mapping)
- IRQ ownership must not be double-registered or double-disabled
- platform/subdevice bring-up order matters

### 2. Demosaic/CFA path remains highly sensitive

The following were identified as real color-path concerns:

- live CFA pattern programming at register `0x8`
- DMSC output option ownership around register `0x4800`
- DMSC gain refresh ordering during total-gain updates

### 3. Gamma parity had real mismatches

The gamma path needed OEM-style register programming:

- `0x40000` (R)
- `0x48000` (G)
- `0x50000` (B)

This is now understood and implemented, but gamma alone did not resolve the blobs.

### 4. Not all remaining problems are “logic bugs”

The OEM tuning manifest shows that several subsystems still rely on synthetic, zeroed, or placeholder data. This means some remaining image-quality failures are likely caused by missing OEM-calibrated tables, not just bad control flow.

## Known Synthetic / Placeholder Areas

Based on `OEM_TUNING_BLOB_MANIFEST.md`, the biggest remaining data-quality gaps are:

1. ~~**AE tables**~~ — RESOLVED: ae0_ev_list and _lum_list now loaded from tuning binary; ae0_tune2 reimplemented with OEM-exact EV-domain convergence, EV FIFO, and histogram-based brightness feedback (data_9a2ec). See `docs/AE_CONVERGENCE_ARCHITECTURE.md`.
2. **ADR/WDR tone-mapping tables**
3. **BCSH / CCM / WB tables**
4. **MDNS / RDNS / SDNS banks**

Important interpretation: even if register sequencing is correct, visibly wrong output can persist if the active tables are still synthetic.

## AE Subsystem — Current Status (2026-04-14)

The AE convergence controller has been reimplemented to match the OEM ae0_tune2 (0x500b8). Key findings and status:

### Resolved
- **Domain mismatch**: _lum_list values are EV-domain targets (100-140K), not 0-255 brightness. The OEM compares target/FIFO_average (both EV domain), not target/wmean.
- **Brightness feedback**: `data_9a2ec=1` enables histogram-based scaling of ev_list/lum_list tables by `(256 - wmean/2) / 256`. This is the mechanism that connects scene brightness to EV-domain convergence.
- **EV FIFO**: 15-entry temporal smoothing using previous-frame tisp_ae_target outputs (stable lum_list values), not volatile IT*AG*DG products.
- **Cold-start ramp**: Emergency brightness-based ratio (target=128/wmean, capped 2x) active when wmean < 10 to bootstrap from black image.
- **Zone data**: Separate R/G/B per-zone arrays extracted from 4-word AE DMA entries.
- **ae0_weight_mean2**: Reimplemented with OEM algorithm (separate R/G/B, 64-bit weighted accumulation, channel mixing).

### Remaining Work
- Full OEM gain distribution (Phase H): threshold-based mode using data_c46a8 reference
- tisp_ae_tune function: scene-adaptive EV table adjustment (arg28 callback in OEM)
- Anti-flicker correction factor in ae0_weight_mean2
- OEM arg4/arg5 dark/bright pixel correction in ae0_weight_mean2
- Complete OEM Tiziano_ae0_fpga histogram processing (mode 1 highlight weighting)

## Highest-Value Remaining Technical Hypotheses

### Hypothesis A: The live false-color issue is still concentrated in the early color path

The most likely live-path suspects remain:

- **GIB** (highest-confidence single block suspect)
- LSC
- YDNS

Reason: after restoring the effective crisp whitelist, the strongest residual delta from the OEM-style broad set is in these blocks, while ADR and MDNS are still guarded or parked in practice.

### Hypothesis B: Table content is now as important as control flow

The project has already fixed several obvious sequencing and register-path mismatches. The next large quality gains are likely to require replacing placeholder content with OEM-backed parameter data, especially for AE, CCM/BCSH, gamma-adjacent tables, and denoise banks.

## Product Requirements

### Functional requirements

- Normal streaming must produce stable color without large green/magenta blobs
- Day/night switching must not corrupt color or wedge the pipeline
- WDR enable/disable must execute without hangs and with sane output
- Core `libimp.so` controls for exposure, white balance, and tuning must remain functional

### Quality requirements

- Output must be visually comparable to OEM in daylight and indoor lighting
- No frame-stable color blobs in neutral scenes
- No persistent CFA-phase corruption after sensor flips or mode changes
- No catastrophic regressions when enabling candidate ISP blocks

### Engineering requirements

- Every tuning fix must be tied to either OEM HLIL evidence or a documented empirical comparison
- New data/table imports must have a provenance note (blob range, OEM array, or inferred mapping)
- Validation must produce reproducible captures/logs for before/after comparison

## Execution Plan

### Phase 0 — Freeze a reproducible baseline

- record the exact “crisp-ish” and “broken” checkpoints
- capture the effective top-bypass set, mode, sensor mbus code, and flip state
- save reference screenshots for daylight, indoor warm light, and low light

### Phase 1 — Build a repeatable validation harness

- standardize capture scenes and camera placement
- standardize logs to collect around `tisp_init`, `tiziano_dmsc_init`, `tiziano_gamma_init`, and top-bypass lines
- record per-run block-enable state and current mode (day/night, WDR, shvflip)

### Phase 2 — Finish live-path block parity

Focus on blocks that can directly create visible early-pipeline corruption:

1. GIB
2. LSC
3. YDNS
4. residual DMSC/CFA edge cases

For each block:

- confirm OEM init sequence
- confirm enable/bypass semantics
- confirm register windows and trigger/commit writes
- test block enabled vs bypassed with fixed scene captures

### Phase 3 — Replace synthetic OEM-data gaps

Recommended reconstruction order:

1. AE tables
2. Gamma / degamma adjacent tuning content
3. BCSH / CCM / WB tables
4. ADR/WDR tone-mapping tables
5. RDNS / MDNS / SDNS banks

This order follows both current manifest confidence and likely image-quality payoff.

### Phase 4 — Mode-complete validation

- day mode
- night mode
- WDR on/off
- sensor flip / mirror combinations
- stream stop/start and second-stream stability

## Deliverables

### D1. Baseline capture pack

- labeled screenshots/video frames
- matching logs
- commit hashes / module parameters used

### D2. Block parity sheets

Per major block, document:

- OEM function(s)
- open-source function(s)
- register ranges
- current status: OEM-parity / partial / synthetic / parked

### D3. Table provenance sheet

For each imported or reconstructed table, document:

- blob source range
- destination arrays/functions
- confidence level
- visual impact observed

### D4. Final acceptance report

- comparison against OEM captures
- unresolved differences
- recommended defaults for production use

## Risks

- False positives from changing multiple blocks at once
- Good control flow still producing bad images because of placeholder tables
- WDR / MDNS / ADR changes causing hangs even when they look architecturally correct
- Overfitting to a single sensor/mode/scene

## Dependencies

- OEM Binary Ninja access for function-level parity
- consistent hardware test setup
- known-good reference captures from OEM driver where possible
- stable way to extract or map OEM tuning blob content into open-source arrays

## Suggested Work Queue From Here

1. Keep the new documentation current
2. Build the baseline capture pack
3. Do a controlled block matrix around GIB / LSC / YDNS from the `0xDD04` baseline
4. Start importing real AE tables from the identified OEM blob ranges
5. Move next to BCSH/CCM/WB and denoise-bank content

## Exit Criteria

This effort is complete when:

- normal streaming output is visually sane across representative scenes
- no persistent false-color blob artifacts remain
- day/night and WDR transitions work without hangs or gross corruption
- the main remaining differences vs OEM are minor, documented, and acceptable

## Progress Log

### 2026-04-03: Phase 3 Data Extraction + Phase 2 Block Testing

**Completed (Phase 3 data extraction):**

1. **Gamma LUT** — Replaced 256-entry identity linear ramp with real OEM 129-entry gamma curves extracted from tx-isp-t31.ko tuning blob. Old data was `{0x000, 0x008, 0x010, ...}` (no gamma correction). OEM curve has proper shadow lift. However: tuning bin IS loaded at runtime and overrides these defaults, so the change is a fallback improvement.

2. **AE tables** — Replaced ~30 all-zero AE parameter structs with OEM data: center-weighted 15x15 zone map, exposure thresholds, EV lists, log2/weight LUTs, flicker detection, scene parameters, WDR and AE1 variants. Same caveat: overridden by tuning bin at runtime.

3. **BCSH/CCM** — Replaced zero-initialized BCSH arrays with OEM data: CCM matrices (d/t/a), hue-dependent parameters, saturation lists, clip parameters, and MMatrix/MinvMatrix color space transforms.

4. **SDNS** — OEM data extracted but array sizes mismatch (OEM uses 4/9-element arrays, our driver has 16). Structural fix deferred.

**Key finding:** The tuning bin IS loaded by libimp at runtime and overrides all initial values. The gamma, AE, and BCSH data we embedded serve as proper fallback defaults when the tuning bin is unavailable.

**Tested (Phase 2 block enable):**

- **GIB + LSC enabled together (0xDD34):** SEVERE REGRESSION — large color blobs spanning entire frame. Immediately reverted to 0xDD04.

**Root cause analysis of GIB+LSC regression:**

- LSC writes registers 0x28000-0x4A8A0 (651 iterations x 3 channels x 16-byte stride), a huge range
- Runtime tuning data shows `mesh_size=48x36`, `mesh_scale=0`, `lut_count=1953` — these are real GC2053 data from libimp, NOT from .ko defaults
- With `mesh_scale=0`, `base_strength=0x800` and `lsc_curr_str=0` at init, all LSC values collapse to 0x800 (flat) — but even flat writes to that register range may conflict with other ISP state
- GIB alone has NOT been tested separately — registers are limited to 0x1030-0x1070 range, much smaller footprint

**Next steps:**

1. Test GIB alone (isp_block_enable=0xDD24) to isolate which block causes regression
2. Investigate LSC mesh_scale=0 behavior — may need special handling
3. Investigate whether the 0x28000+ register range overlaps with active ISP blocks
4. Consider whether LSC needs lsc_curr_str > 0 before enabling (currently 0 = no correction)
