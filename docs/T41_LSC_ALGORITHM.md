# T41 lens-shading algorithm recovery

The native kernel adapter owns calibration and history, receives live CT/gain
from the drained frame worker and replaces the captured CT/gain seeds. The
adapter has passed physical T41 testing and is deployed in the surgical
`/opt` stack; this does not establish full AWB/AE or image-quality parity.

`tx_isp_t41_lsc.h` implements temperature selection/history, gain selection
and register packing for the T41 calibration format. It supports both mesh
and radial-ring layouts, including the optional IR ring. Inputs are sensor
calibration, dimensions/layout and live temperature/gain; no captured live
curves or sensor identity participate.

Four calibrated temperature breakpoints define three constant-table zones
and two blending zones. Blending aligns each plane's binary exponent, then
uses Q12 linear interpolation with OEM unsigned wrap and halfword narrowing.
The temperature update threshold is inclusive; the gain threshold is strict.
Constant-table zones suppress redundant temperature updates.

The format has two distinct exponent groups: mesh planes use bytes
`0x5f..0x67`; ring planes use `0x53..0x5e`. The replaced kernel mesh path
incorrectly used ring exponents. Other corrected differences are the 23-bit
mask on register `0x3018`, the lack of a gain-register write for CT-only
updates, and complete hardware-bank packing even when the interpolation
count is smaller. Unused scratch must retain history in that last case.

Mesh interpolation consumes up to 2,304 samples in each of three planes.
Rings consume 577 samples per RGB plane and optionally IR. Each ring hardware
entry combines adjacent samples, so 576 entries are produced; optional IR
entries pair IR with green. Register words pack six 12-bit values into 72
bits. Calibration occupies `0xd880` bytes, state/history `0x6c38` bytes.

QEMU and the physical T41 each pass 10,000 synthetic cases spanning all five
CT zones, threshold boundaries, history sequences, both layouts, IR on/off,
both gain-table banks and all four register-writer modes: zero mismatches
and unexpected writes. The independent host test passes another 10,000 cases
with ASan/UBSan, short-buffer rejection and canaries. The oracle has private
state and a register recorder; it does not access ISP hardware or import a
sensor bin. OEM instructions are confined to this test executable and are
never linked into the driver.

The expanded oracle also covers 2,000 mesh flips (including odd dimensions,
padded columns, ring mode and IR), 10,000 geometry diagnostics, forty cold
starts, and 320 linear/WDR, flip and day/night replacements. No compatible
input mismatches were found in QEMU and on the physical T41. Nineteen oversized geometry products
are rejected before the OEM's 16-bit narrowing can wrap; they are reported
separately rather than counted as parity matches. Host sanitizers cover cold
starts, flipped calibration refreshes and double-flip restoration as well.

Cold initialization uses the OEM's universal 5000 K / unity-gain state,
not this sensor's measured running state. Mirroring transforms each of nine
calibrated mesh planes and the optical-center coordinates, retaining the
padding column. Day/night refresh starts from replacement calibration and
reapplies the saved orientation. These are algorithm/lifecycle tests, not
physical sensor WDR validation.

The setter oracle adds 1,600 parameter-part transfers, including flipped
tables. OEM parts 1..3 only stage data; part 4 completes the transfer and
reapplies orientation. Controls (part 0) are a separate immediate operation.
The native adapter preserves that transaction boundary while allowing frame
updates against the last committed calibration. Bad pointers or geometry do
not replace the active map. A host harness includes the actual kernel adapter
with private memory and MMIO recording, checking ownership, allocation/restore
failure unwinding, staged transfers, CT/gain hysteresis, complete RAM commits,
PM save/restore and stop-before-free ordering. No LSC RAM writes occur in the
hard IRQ path. Repeated unchanged inputs avoid copying/interpolating state.

## Live validation

Source `0fec0835` (LSC adapter `94679abb`) produces the tested stripped module
SHA256 `a6a84b2b9b4ce1df6e445589becd331896e93fedb5da18fff011fd2dbd9abf95`.
Both candidates pass three TCP and three UDP H.264/AAC reconnects and a clean
120-second decode, with zero reported duplicate/drop frames or timestamp
warnings. Native LSC follows live CT and gain: the temporary exposure ceiling
test reaches log2-Q16 gain 259142 with LSC/LCE/TMO errors zero, then returns
to calibrated exposure. The final build suppresses normal gain-fanout debug
MMIO/logging; explicit tracing and rate-limited failures remain available.

Promotion ran before S10 bind mounts, with the preceding module and complete
manifest retained in `/opt/t41-iq/generic-rollback-8d`. A fresh boot verifies
all twenty artifacts, unchanged sensor calibration and saved the application config,
day mode, advancing tuning work and another six passing reconnects. Neo
audio and the other deployed libraries/binaries are unchanged. No firmware
partition was flashed.

The adjacent OEM/open scene captures show paper luma 221.84/221.50 and bark
luma 84.59/85.64. Paper R/G is 0.9821/0.9761 and B/G 1.0672/1.0233. Lighting,
exposure and white balance are not locked, so these are observational
regression checks, not correction coefficients or color-parity evidence.
Physical ring/IR and sensor WDR operation are not proven by this OS04D10 run;
those mathematical paths are covered by the synthetic OEM oracles.

Calibration tables remain legitimate sensor inputs; a measured scene's
CT/gain is not a default. Full AWB/AE convergence and long-stream reliability
remain separate outstanding work.
