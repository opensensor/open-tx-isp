# T31 TX-ISP Driver

## Organization

The T31 implementation is the most decomposed active driver and is the
reference layout for future T23/T41 extractions.  The split is behavioral, not
just cosmetic:

- `tx_isp_module.c` owns module lifecycle, platform resources, frame-channel
  ioctls, and buffer bookkeeping.
- `tx_isp_core.c` owns ISP-core probe, MMIO, core IRQ handling, and MSCA frame
  completion.
- `tx_isp_csi.c`, `tx_isp_vic.c`, `tx_isp_vin.c`, and `tx_isp_fs.c` own their
  corresponding subdevices.
- `tx_isp_tuning.c` owns the recovered Tiziano tuning implementation and the
  proprietary `libimp.so` control ABI.
- `tx_isp_daynight.c`, `tx_isp_callback_plan.c`, and
  `tx_isp_reg_profile.c` adapt T31 behavior to shared library units.
- `tx_isp_tuning_abi.c` links checked shared libimp envelopes, command
  descriptors, and response packers.
- `tx_isp_frame_layout.c` links checked NV12 and MDNS auxiliary geometry while
  T31 retains its alignment, register, allocation, and memory-option policy.
- `tx_isp_t31_subdev_resolver.c` supplies T31's typed graph and established
  raw pad-direction mapping to the common name/type/index resolver.
- Pad allocation delegates the common five-word active-link initializer while
  retaining T31's raw pad-slot mapping. The complete pad type is asserted as
  the OEM 0x24-byte wire object.
- The shared frame-buffer ABI asserts T31's 68-byte MIPS32 `v4l2_buffer`
  contract, names its persistent flag mask, and defines the recovered
  FREE/QUEUED/ACTIVE/DONE slot states; T31 retains queue ownership.
- `frame_image_format` embeds the shared fixed 48-byte pixel descriptor instead
  of Ingenic's GCC-5.4-only `v4l2_pix_format` extension. This restores the
  private format from 96 to the OEM/libimp 112 bytes on modern compilers.
- The outer frame dispatcher and ISP/VIC handoffs use the shared proven event
  IDs and legacy-`V` ioctl envelopes; generation-specific events above
  buffer-done remain local.
- Compile-time checks pin the typed five-word active-link record to the common
  20-byte MIPS32 layout and the pad private pointer/stride to 0x20/0x24. The
  former extra callback was removed because it made the C type wider than the
  allocator's OEM stride.
- Target assertions also pin the declared 8-byte endpoint, 20-byte graph-link
  configuration, and 8-byte configuration-set envelope to the common wire ABI.
- `tx_isp_t31_exposure.c` adapts the shared exposure library to the T31
  deflicker LUT's fixed 120-word, repeated-tail ABI.
- `tx_isp_sinfo.c` supplies the T31 adapter for the shared sensor registry.
- `tx_isp_fixpt.c`, `tx_isp_ae_zone.c`, and `tx_isp_frame_done.c` isolate
  arithmetic, AE-zone, and frame-sync behavior from the large tuning unit.

Register addresses, recovered object layouts, IRQ acknowledgement, tuning
tables, and sensor-specific profiles remain T31-local.

## Public V4L2 adapter

Build the optional `/dev/video0` capture adapter with
`CONFIG_TX_ISP_T31_V4L2=y`. The target kernel must provide
`CONFIG_VIDEO_DEV=y`, `CONFIG_VIDEO_V4L2=y`, and
`CONFIG_DMA_SHARED_BUFFER=y`; the adapter intentionally stops at compile time
when DMA-BUF support is absent instead of producing a module with unresolved
symbols. The T31 module routes CIM MCLK to PA15 during initialization, so the
adapter does not require the in-tree TX-ISP driver to own sensor pinmux.

## Current SC301IOT Runtime

The August 13-25, 2026 Wyze Video Doorbell v2 work added a third live T31
sensor family and exercised three separate SC301IOT units:

- the open driver and OpenIMP deliver stable processed main/sub streams on the
  2048x1536 sensor mode, including fleet runs on three physical doorbells
- CSI lanes, Bayer code/phase, dimensions, integration/gain limits, apply
  delays, and exposure capabilities are derived from the bound sensor rather
  than GC2053 or SC2336 literals
- the AE0 static and histogram DMA paths feed the recovered per-frame Tiziano
  software controller; a same-scene stock/open daylight comparison reached
  near-stock color and exposure on the validated doorbell profile
- a live rear-door test exposed a delayed highlight-retention failure: the
  first frame held a blue sky and later frames washed it out because a generic
  zero scene-control request was encoded as an active OEM level
- zero/no-override now preserves the active tuning bank's calibrated
  highlight/backlight behavior, while explicit non-zero levels retain the OEM
  encoding; the fix is generic policy, not an SC301IOT special case

This proves the generic sensor-attribute path and the SC301IOT daylight AE
loop. It does not claim night/IR, WDR, or every 50/60 Hz lighting condition is
already at OEM parity.

## Current GC2053 Runtime

The August 5, 2026 Wyze Cam v3 cycle added a second T31 sensor oracle:

- the corrected 0x24-byte pad ABI consumed its one-shot marker, registered one
  GC2053 at address `0x37`, kept Raptor and ISP/W02/AVPU interrupts advancing,
  and decoded 358 1920x1080 frames in 12 seconds without a driver fault
- the recovered CLM bank assignment is H/H at `0x60000/0x68000` and S/S at
  `0x70000/0x78000`; this matches both the T31 OEM HLIL and the T23 recovered
  implementation
- loading H, S, and shift from tuning-block offsets `0xfb84`, `0xff9e`, and
  `0x107d4` reproduces all four stock GC2053 CLM banks byte-for-byte
- with exact CLM data, AE recovers to the stock operating range and both
  1920x1080 and 640x360 streams remain decoder-clean at 30 fps
- image parity is not complete: with GIB active, AWB DMA has zero RGB sums and
  the frame is severely magenta; bypassing only GIB restores RGB sums in at
  least 219 of 225 zones and recognizable color. The default remains
  OEM-aligned with GIB active so this remaining defect is visible rather than
  silently hidden
- every candidate was loaded through the one-shot fail-safe path, and the
  camera was power-cycled back to the persistent 831,776-byte stock module
  after each experiment

## Current SC2336 Runtime

The July 30-31, 2026 device cycles validated the open module on the real T31
SC2336 camera through the stock Ingenic userspace and Raptor:

- main/sub RTSP streams initialize and remain responsive
- forced night and day transitions produce top masks `0xB574224D` and
  `0xB5742209`
- lens shading is enabled by default (`force_bypass_lsc=0`)
- day output has coherent color, geometry, lens shading, and tonal continuity
- DMSC register `0x4800` is sourced only from the tuning blob's output/debug
  selector; Bayer routing is not synthesized into this register
- reduced-memory MDNS follows the recovered OEM policy for every sensor by
  disabling ASS, BGM, and PSN when their reference planes are absent; the
  SC2336 top word remains the same-camera stock oracle
  (`0x7814=0x00f01100`)
- duplicate sensor exposure tuples are suppressed after the first successful
  write, avoiding redundant 25 Hz SC2336 timing-register transactions
- the main frame source uses two VBM buffers and rotates QUEUED/ACTIVE/DONE
  ownership before waking DQBUF; userspace receives only DMA-complete frames
  while both RTSP streams retain the configured 25 fps
- frame timestamps are captured at DMA completion instead of at userspace
  dequeue, eliminating scheduler-dependent PTS/DTS jitter and multi-second
  delivery gaps
- MDNS strength remains under the standard tuning control instead of applying
  a sensor-named gain-stage override
- a synchronized stock/open capture at approximately 1200 integration lines
  and sensor gain `0xc4` matched the functional DMSC, sharpen, MDNS/YDNS,
  RDNS, SDNS, and BCSH register programming
- 100 consecutive `get-isp` plus `get-exposure` query pairs complete without
  an ioctl failure, kernel fault, or producer restart
- the main pool now reports the OEM-private `bytesperline=2880` and
  `sizeimage=3133440` consistently, eliminating the former 4,700,160 versus
  3,133,440 producer/consumer mismatch
- the active `isp_memopt=1` MDNS allocation remains exactly `0x2f8740`
- the tested reserved-memory command line is
  `rmem=22M@0x2a00000`; no bootloader environment change is required
- the compiler-independent 112-byte frame format restores the substream from
  76 frames in six seconds to 147 in six seconds while the main stream remains
  full-rate; a second boot decoded 124/122 main/sub frames in five seconds
- the validated frame-channel open module used SHA-256
  `e07d82117a4e37f8d23a97fac6d09acddcce7d551e85ada478e89a6363e25ac1`;
  forced day mode, ISP interrupts, `dmesg`, `logread`, and `logcat` all passed
- the deterministic sequential build uses the shared frame-channel events and
  ioctl envelopes; Raptor reports both streams at 25 fps and saved a fresh
  302,532-byte 1920x1080 JPEG while external monitoring occupied the RTSP
  server's four client slots
- the frame-channel dispatcher now uses the compiler-independent common
  20-byte request-buffer structure and common legacy stream command names;
  its memory-pressure limits and allocation state remain local
- the graph endpoint search now uses the common checked subdevice resolver
  while retaining T31's known raw input/output slot mapping; its one-shot boot
  bound the SC2336 once, applied day mode, advanced ISP/VIC interrupts, and
  decoded 149 1920x1080 frames in six seconds with clean `dmesg`, `logread`,
  and `logcat`; the active module SHA-256 is
  `bb95aba4587061b4d364fd3b3893bbf8d8ec0471252deed97dc996e569d48673`
- the common pad-link state candidate consumed its one-shot marker, bound the
  SC2336 once, accepted forced day mode, advanced ISP/VIC interrupts, and
  decoded 148 1920x1080 frames in six seconds; all three fault scans are clean
  and the responsive candidate remains active with SHA-256
  `322ace762900c81d22e55f527572708f6ae92d6ca144725d52fb58413dd37b4a`
- the final two-buffer module consumed its fail-safe marker, loaded with status
  zero, accepted forced day mode, and returned 300 monotonic main-stream
  packets in 12 seconds with 39.155-41.644 ms DTS spacing; the persistent open
  module SHA-256 is
  `14908c65dd40bb76f538a4a92a0a27803ea89fd8a9a0cdb8c0975516eaeb85a7`

The shared NV12 DMA plan now validates QBUF allocation length, complete
address range, and Y/UV placement before the local tracking and MSCA handoff.
The validation retained exact 3,133,440/353,280-byte pools without rejecting a
live buffer. An earlier one-buffer pre-dequeue experiment decoded 501 main
frames in 20 seconds and 250 substream frames in 10 seconds, but could expose
an ACTIVE buffer before DMA completion; it has been replaced by the safe
two-buffer rotation. The validated module SHA-256 for that earlier cycle was
`8a1e71f3f0479bbc450d5a98f7af910b572b1a5b0b331b03518a4ba466d5d731`.

The common math library now exposes and host-tests the split 64-bit two- and
three-operand Q-format multipliers used by AE tuning. T31 intentionally retains
its local inline compatibility body: routing that body through one additional
header wrapper changed register allocation inside the large recovered AE
function and produced visibly grainier walls despite mathematical equivalence.
Restoring the size-neutral boundary reproduces the accepted tuning object
byte-for-byte. The frame-queue/MDNS work leaves that fragile object untouched
and changes only frame-source/core and outer sensor-work objects.

The DMSC output selector deserves particular care.  Its low bits select
normal or diagnostic DMSC outputs; they are not a CFA index.  Rewriting them
from the sensor media-bus Bayer order produced a monochrome edge/noise image.
The preserved compatibility entry point is therefore a no-op, while
`tisp_dmsc_out_opt_cfg()` writes the tuning-selected word exactly like the
shipping implementation.

## Tuning ABI Corrections

The T31 tuning ioctl carries either a scalar or a userspace pointer in the
same eight-byte control payload.  Keep command routing explicit.  A former
`cmd >= 0x8000023` shortcut interpreted pointer-valued WB, highlight, and
backlight queries as scalars.

The wire envelopes, fixed response layouts, sparse-EV extraction, and command
payload descriptors now live in `tx_isp_tuning_abi.h`; T31 retains only the
command table, hardware collectors, and dispatch policy.

`tisp_g_ev_attr` is an OEM-shaped sparse 0x80-byte structure.  In particular:

- current exposure lines are word 0
- exposure microseconds are word 2
- minimum/maximum integration lines are halfwords at byte offsets
  `0x6c`/`0x6e`
- one-line duration in microseconds is the halfword at byte offset `0x7c`

Do not turn these byte offsets into `uint32_t` indices.  The old
`ev_buffer[0x37]` write landed at byte `0xdc`, beyond both the OEM object and
the caller's former eight-word stack buffer.

`apical_isp_expr_g_ctrl` must return the exact 12-byte
`IMPISPExpr.g_attr` layout:

```text
u32 mode
u16 integration_time
u16 integration_time_min
u16 integration_time_max
u16 one_line_expr_in_us
```

The histogram interrupt invalidates the selected DMA bank before unpacking
it, matching the OEM driver.  A live T31L/SC2336 probe reported all 518,400
pixels across 241 nonzero bins and a frame-responsive weighted mean.
`tisp_ae_g_luma` retains the per-zone AE weighted mean as a defensive fallback
only when the histogram-derived value is zero.

## Front crop (`IMP_ISP_Tuning_SetFrontCrop`)

A window is accepted when every running channel's scaler output is at most 2.0x the window per axis (module parameter `fcrop_upscale_pct`, default and maximum 100; the vendor enlarges without a check, the T31X MSCA hung at 2.5x). Larger enlargements are refused with -EINVAL and a log line, windows are dropped at the last ISP close and when a larger main stream starts. `fcrop_upscale_pct=0` refuses every upscale. Device-tested on the T31L (2.0x, 1.5x) and the T31X (2.0x). Logic: `tx_isp_t31_fcrop.h`, host test `tests/tx_isp_t31_fcrop_test.c`.

## Known Gaps

- T23/T41 still need their own device-backed ownership tests before the full
  T31 queue lifecycle can move behind a common implementation rather than only
  sharing slot-state names.
- Raptor's exposure summary still reports zero WB statistic gains even though
  the main WB ioctl returns live nonzero red/blue gains.
- Motion-region denoise parity still needs a synchronized stock/open capture;
  static same-light register and flat-region measurements are not sufficient
  to validate the MDNS motion classifier.
- More tuning internals should move into logical files, but extractions must
  retain OEM callback order and be tested on-device.
- T31's native 64-bit multiply shim can move to the common header only after
  the resulting recovered AE machine code is proven byte-identical or the
  surrounding function has been made free of code-generation-sensitive
  recovered constructs.

## AWB statistics sweeps (`t31_awb_impl`)

The per-frame colour-temperature detection has three implementations: 0 = reference C, 1 = fast C, 2 = MXU2 (default). MXU2 is used only after a load-time selftest passed (bit-exact against the reference on random scenes); otherwise the fast C path runs. Writing `t31_awb_impl=0/1` switches MXU2 off. Measured on a T31X and a T31L: identical results, about 2.4x faster sweeps (96 sweeps: 1229 us in C, 504 us with MXU2).

Note on CPM 0x10000034 (read-only `t31_mxu2_cpm`, 0x101 or 0x110): this is CPPSR, a clock-module part register (libimp uses it to tell full parts from "-L" parts). It is not an MXU or MXU2 enable flag and does not gate MXU2; MXU2 works on both values. On the T21N the CU2 bit can be set but MXU2 instructions are reserved (the vendor libimp never enables SIMD on T21), so this path is T31-only.

## Build and Check

```bash
SOC=t31 ./build_local.sh
driver/t31/verify_no_divdi3.sh driver/t31/tx-isp-t31.ko
make -C tests check
git diff --check
```

Load experiments through the one-shot boot hook.  Do not live-unload the ISP
stack while the sensor and Ingenic userspace hold its objects.

## Testing in QEMU

The modules can be loaded, unloaded and exercised without a camera in the `ingenic-t31` machine of the [gtxaspec/qemu](https://github.com/gtxaspec/qemu) `ingenic-txx` branch (boots the thingino image (128 MB, sc2336 sensor model), the ISP comes up with 1080p + 360p and the streamer runs; 10 reload cycles showed no oops but a pending-interrupt message on every cycle (`irq 38: nobody cared`) until the interrupt status was masked and acknowledged before `request_irq`). It is a crash-test bench, not a picture-quality bench: the ISP is a register-file model with a modelled frame path (synthetic colour-bar frames), there are no 3A statistics, and timing and image quality cannot be tested. Setup, per-SoC status and limits: [docs/QEMU_TESTING.md](../../docs/QEMU_TESTING.md).

## Module parameter `isp_memopt`

`isp_memopt` selects the smaller ISP memory layout (the MDNS allocation is `0x2f8740`, which fits `rmem=22M`). Default `1`; `isp_memopt=0` loads the larger OEM layout. Device-tested with `1` on the T31L and the T31X (sc4336p).

## Module parameter `isp_bypass_graph`

`isp_bypass_graph=1` enables the vendor ISP bypass graph (OEM `IMP_ISP_Tuning_SetISPBypass(DISABLE)`: link config 1, the ISP core is skipped and frame channel 0 delivers the sensor's raw frame from the VIC MDMA as `RG12`, 1920x1080 = 4147200 bytes on the sc2336 board). Default `0`: the link ioctls only store the configuration index, nothing else changes. Use order (as the OEM sample): create the channel, SetISPBypass(DISABLE), set the RAW format, enable the channel; after SetISPBypass(ENABLE) the raw channel delivers no more frames and has to be recreated (OEM behaviour). Device-tested on the T31L (sc2336); nothing consumes it yet.
