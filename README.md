</p>

Open reimplementation of Ingenic's closed TX-ISP kernel driver (`tx-isp-<soc>.ko`) for
T10, T20, T21, T23, T30, T31, T40 and T41. The goal is behavioural equivalence with the
OEM driver: same ioctl and `libimp` ABI, same register sequencing, same image behaviour,
with cleaner unload/reload, checked inputs and less memory.

It works with Ingenic's unmodified `libimp.so` and with the open replacement
[OpenIMP](https://github.com/opensensor/openimp). Open stack = open-tx-isp + OpenIMP + a camera application. The `aperto` branch carries the released open stack on top of the original `main` line; see
[Branches and releases](#branches-and-releases).

This is a reverse-engineering and compatibility effort, not a greenfield pipeline: OEM binary
analysis, `libimp` ABI work and recovery of tuning data.

## Status

**Newest release candidate: RC2 `v2026.10.25-rc2` (open-tx-isp `next` 1bf4549d + docs, with OpenIMP `next` 7c30aa99 + docs; runs on all 19 test cameras): see the CHANGELOG entry and the [release note](https://github.com/opensensor/openimp/blob/aperto/docs/RELEASE_NOTES_RC2.md).** Previous: **RC1 v2026.10.11-rc1: openimp fe9307c (agg-35 687a68e4 + docs), open-tx-isp 191be6c5 (agg-35 6e464ac7 + docs).** Release SoCs: T10, T20, T21, T23, T31; T30, T40 and T41 are experimental. The agg-35 soak of 2026-10-10/11 on 10 cameras was clean (0 oopses, 0 unexplained reboots, 0 application restarts). Release notes and known issues: [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md). The per-SoC table below dates from 2026-10-04. "Fully open" = open driver, OpenIMP and the camera application run from a flashed image.

**After RC1: aggregate agg-37 (`claude/agg-37`, not released; host tests and module builds only, device tests pending):** smaller modules (T31 export whitelist checked by `tests/check_isp_exports.sh`, T10/T20 `--gc-sections`, T23 bring-up parameters only with `TX_ISP_T23_BRINGUP_PARAMS=y`; numbers in `docs/SIZE.md`), T23 `SwitchBin` rework, T23/T31 `msca_flip_state`, T10/T20 safe anti-fog preset and lens-shading scale, T10/T20 scaler size fix after `SET_SCALER`, quiet T23/T40 kernel logs (`t23_runtime_trace=1` / `t40_runtime_trace=1` bring the notes back), T41 `t41_msca_enable_at_frame` (diagnostic, default 0) the report-only `/proc/jz/isp` watcher `t41_proc_watch` and the T41 stability fixes (`/dev/isp-m0` handle count, out-of-object accesses, quiet log with `t41_runtime_trace=1`). Details: [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

Earlier state: the release candidate (`claude/agg-28` on top of `next`, 2026-10-06 evening). "Fully open" = open driver, OpenIMP and the camera application run from a flashed image. Release plan: `next` goes to `aperto` (fast-forward) after the long soak and is tagged `vYYYY.MM.DD`; the first release covers T10 (not re-tested on the open stack today), T20, T21, T23 and T31; T41 is not part of it.

| SoC | Status |
|---|---|
| T10 | Fully open; day/night, reload (5 cycles) and boot guard verified. Image controls partly documented. Module 731 KB. **Not re-tested** on 2026-10-06 (shares the T20 firmware base). Front crop window kept while no downscaled channel is open and released with the tuning session (agg-34, device-tested). |
| T20 | Fully open; 1 h 44 min soak without errors, 10x stop/start and reload without an oops, `rmmod` during streaming refused. Module 736 KB. apitest of the release candidate: 212 PASS / 0 FAIL on two cameras. Same front-crop fix as T10 (agg-34); `isp-m0` reports the reachable analog gain cap (smaller of the sensor maximum and the `SetMaxAgain` ceiling), which the application needs for day/night (agg-34, host-tested). |
| T21 | First open bring-up, now fully open; AE/ADR/defog/AWB lifted from the vendor module. Module 452 KB (vendor 616). `SetBrightness` acts and sepia works (beyond vendor). apitest of the release candidate: 228 PASS / 0 FAIL on two cameras. |
| T23 | Fully open (native encoder in OpenIMP); module 622 KB (vendor 857); vendor AE default. Frequent Helix frame drops fixed (residual interrupt, kernel patch merged upstream); stock-like release defaults, MSCA scratch buffer, AF statistics on by default (see "T23 module parameters"). Open: **a FrameSource crop change stops the pipeline (under investigation, release blocker)**, a rare single Helix encode error (errno 5), no real WDR. Front crop (agg-34, device-tested): crop off unlocks the window, a window that does not fit is dropped instead of hanging the MSCA (the 2026-10-06 crop hang), the lock is released with the ISP session, module parameter `fcrop_upscale_pct`. |
| T30 | Builds against a real T30 kernel; earlier bring-up on hardware. Not exercised on a camera in the latest campaign; driver fixes of 2026-11-01 (second-channel start, `GetSensorRegister`, ISP init window) are proven in QEMU only. |
| T31 | Reference SoC; SC2336, GC2053, SC301IOT; 2 h 53 min soak without errors; module 711 KB (vendor 829). `SetFrameDrop` with the stock semantics. H.264 stall after JPEG teardown fixed (OpenIMP agg-29). **Front crop (agg-34):** the crash from a window the MSCA would have to upscale is fixed (the kernel refuses it with -EINVAL, module parameter `fcrop_upscale_pct`, default 0); the picture effect of a valid window is **experimental, not proven**. |
| T40 | Runs from a flashed image on the T40XP test camera (sc830ai) with the open ISP driver: day/night, AE/AWB from the hardware statistics, tuning API with device tests (2026-10-31 run, image agg60: apitest all areas plus 28 cases PASS 270 / FAIL 0, 0 oops; gamma curve, stale frame after a pause and scaler level fixed, #167/#168/#169). CPU load is vendor-like (ISP busy 1.6 % against 1.4 %, #133); the lost-argument call sites of the lifted code are fixed (#140). Open: ISP OSD picture of the Set calls (#141). See CHANGELOG and the GitHub issues (`soc:T40`). |
| T41 | **Not part of the first release (experimental).** Fully open from a flashed image (H.264, H.265), reload verified; the use-after-free of the I2C sensor client when DelSensor races a running frame work is fixed (#134, QEMU only so far). Open items: see the CHANGELOG and the GitHub issues (`soc:T41`). |

**Completeness** of the vendor API at RC1 (done = device-tested + host-tested + audited): T10 89.2 %, T20 90.5 %, T21 93.2 %, T23 93.8 %, T31 96.4 % (release), T41 59.3 %, T40 25.4 %, T30 not device-audited (experimental). Table: [OpenIMP README, Completeness](https://github.com/opensensor/openimp/blob/aperto/README.md#completeness). Release notes: [docs/RELEASE-v2026.10.11-rc1.md](docs/RELEASE-v2026.10.11-rc1.md).

## T23 module parameters (release candidate defaults)

Defaults of `tx-isp-t23.ko` in the release candidate. The switches are `0644` module parameters (changeable at run time through `/sys/module/tx_isp_t23/parameters/`) except where noted; the stock-like set is the one that ran 7 h overnight plus many stream restarts. Parameters marked "debug" exist for bisecting and are not needed in normal operation.

| Parameter | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `chan_stop_keep_input` | 1 | Keep the input (CSI, sensor, VIC, TISP core) running after the last frame channel STREAMOFF while the ISP is streaming, as stock does; an on-demand wake then restarts no hardware. 0 stops the input with the last channel (debug; hangs together with `msca_fifo_rearm=1`) |
| `msca_keep_enabled` | 2 | What STREAMOFF does with the MSCA output enable bit: 0 clear, 1 keep when the input stops too, 2 always keep (stock style) |
| `msca_fifo_rearm` | 0 | 1 clears and refills a stopped channel's MSCA address FIFO at STREAMON (debug; stock never does) |
| `msca_flip_skip_noop` | 1 | No MSCA update request for unchanged mirror/flip bits |
| `msca_restart_skip` | 1 | No MSCA reload on STREAMON of a still-enabled output with unchanged geometry |
| `msca_session_release` | 1 | An ISP STREAMON with the input stopped switches off MSCA outputs left enabled and clears their FIFOs |
| `msca_scratch` | 1 | STREAMOFF parks a kept MSCA output on a scratch area at the tail of the ISP buffer (900 KiB at 720p), QBUFs of a parked channel are held until STREAMON, the input waits until the scratch address was consumed. Read-only counters `msca_scratch_parks`, `_frames`, `_deferred`, `_skips`, `_settle_timeouts`, `_settle_ticks_max`. 0 = off (first thing to try if a stop/start hangs) |
| `chan_stop_drain` | 21 | STREAMOFF waits up to N x 10 ms until the channel's queued buffers have left the hardware (stock: 21); 0 = no wait. Counters `chan_drain_waits`, `chan_drain_timeouts`, `chan_drain_ticks_max` |
| `qbuf_cache_inv` | 1 | QBUF invalidates the buffer's cache lines before its addresses reach the FIFO (as stock); 0 = off (debug) |
| `source_af` | 1 (read-only) | AF statistics chain of the stock module: AF block, AF interrupt and the AF getters/setters. 0 = AF off and the controls unrouted. No measurable CPU or interrupt cost |
| `source_ae_oem` | 1 (read-only) | Lifted vendor AE (default since 2026-10-03) |
| `crumbs` | 0 | Hang step markers in a reserved page (1 = rmem page after the MDNS buffer, 2 = page at `crumb_addr`); only for hang analysis |
| `t23_runtime_trace` | 0 | 1 enables informational driver logging |
| `fcrop_upscale_pct` | 0 | Percentage by which the front-crop geometry check tolerates an MSCA upscale (0 = no upscaling allowed). Measured on T23: upscaling up to 2.0 works, at 2.2 the MSCA stalled briefly and the crop was dropped without a reboot. The same parameter exists in `tx-isp-t31.ko` (writable under `/sys/module/tx_isp_t31/parameters/`); the T31 limit was not established, leave it at 0 |
| `msca_flip_state` | read-only | Who flips each axis, as a bit mask: 1 sensor_h, 2 sensor_v, 4 isp_h, 8 isp_v. The sensor bits are set when the sensor accepted the flip event (sc2336p: register 0x3221), the ISP bits follow the MSCA mirror/flip word (0xd050). With image hflip and vflip both stages flip on T23 (`shvflip=1` only flips the lens-shading mesh), so an application that mirrors a crop window must apply both. Same parameter in `tx-isp-t31.ko` (bits for the sensor flip request of `apical_isp_hvflip_update` and the MSCA mask) |
| `isp_clk`, `isp_clka` | 153000000, 416000000 (load time only) | ISP core and AXI clocks in Hz; since the candidate they really reach the hardware (before, the activation path read the wrong clock-table slot) |

## T10/T20 module parameters

`tx-isp-t10.ko` and `tx-isp-t20.ko` share one firmware unit. Parameters added with the safe anti-fog preset and the lens-shading scale (host-tested; device test pending):

| Parameter | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `t20_antifog_variance` | 0 (`0644`) | 1: the anti-fog presets also write the Iridix variance nibbles (register 0x3c8) at the frame-end interrupt and restore the original value on "off"; 0: strength only. Leave it at 0 until the strength-only path has run on the camera |
| `t20_antifog_level` | read-only | Last accepted anti-fog level: 0 off, 1 strong, 2 medium, 3 weak |
| `t20_antifog_ignored` | read-only | Anti-fog requests that found the Iridix block disabled (nothing is written then) |
| `t20_mesh_scale_cur` | read-only | Lens-shading scale last written by the `SetMeshShadingScale` control (255 = none yet) |

## Better than the vendor driver

- Reload and stop: 10 stop/start and rmmod/insmod cycles without an oops on T20/T21/T23/T31/T41 (T10: 5 cycles).
- T40: rmmod resets the VICs and switches the AE/AWB statistics off before their buffers are freed, so a sensor that keeps sending frames cannot make the ISP write into freed memory (the vendor frees them with the statistics running).
- T20/T10 give back about 8 MB RAM (unused 8 MiB V4L2 frame pool off by default); on a T20 the open stack measured 10.5 % application CPU against 25.2 % with the vendor stack, snapshots 0.20 s against 0.45 s.
- Smaller modules than the vendor on T21, T23 and T31.
- Checked inputs (all user copies, QBUF window, bounded waits), sensor module pinned while streaming.
- T21 controls and noise reduction act (the vendor ignores them), T10/T20 noise-reduction strength acts.
- Shortfall logging with a concrete parameter value when reserved memory is too small.

[OPENIMP_BEYOND_VENDOR](https://github.com/opensensor/openimp/blob/aperto/docs/OPENIMP_BEYOND_VENDOR.md).

## Build

Out-of-tree kernel modules, built against a Thingino buildroot output (toolchain and vendor
kernel tree, Linux 3.10.14 for T10-T31, 4.4.94 for T40/T41). The helper picks the SoC with `SOC`:

```sh
SOC=t31 ./build_local.sh          # t10 t20 t21 t23 t30 t31 t40 t41
TH=/path/to/thingino-firmware SOC=t23 ./build_local.sh
```

`TH`, `ROOT`, `KDIR`, `CROSS` and `ARCH` can be overridden (see the comments in `build_local.sh`).
It builds `driver/<soc>/` into `tx-isp-<soc>.ko` plus the diagnostic `driver/tx_isp_trace.ko`; when no
module for the SoC was built locally the result is a compile baseline only. The T20 driver expects the
`external/ingenic-sdk` submodule (`git submodule update --init`). Host tests for kernel-independent
primitives: `make -C tests check`.

## Integration in Thingino

The packages `open-tx-isp` (this driver) and `openimp` (userspace) are in the upstream
[thingino-firmware](https://github.com/themactep/thingino-firmware) branch `aperto`
([#1756](https://github.com/themactep/thingino-firmware/pull/1756)), selected with
`BR2_PACKAGE_THINGINO_ISP_OPEN` (menu "ISP stack") and pinned by commit SHA to the `aperto` branches
of the opensensor repositories. The module is installed as `tx-isp-<soc>.ko` and replaces the proprietary one;
SDK sensor, audio and AVPU modules stay. The kernel VPU/rmem stability patches
([#1748](https://github.com/themactep/thingino-firmware/pull/1748),
[#1752](https://github.com/themactep/thingino-firmware/pull/1752)) are merged there. The optional
boot guard `BR2_PACKAGE_THINGINO_ISP_GUARD` ([#1749](https://github.com/themactep/thingino-firmware/pull/1749),
default off; `isp_open=auto|manual|off`) skips the ISP/sensor modules after an unstable load so a bad
driver cannot boot-loop the camera. Once the first date tag exists on `aperto`, thingino's `aperto` branch will pin that tag instead of a SHA.

## Branches and releases

- `main`: the original author's line (opensensor). It is left untouched and is a strict ancestor of `aperto`.
- `aperto`: the open stack release line: OpenIMP + open-tx-isp, as used by the thingino `aperto` branch. Fast-forward only; every commit was flashed and checked on cameras. Releases are tagged `vYYYY.MM.DD` on this branch, and thingino pins a tag instead of a SHA.
- Development and the device-test campaign happen in the [Lu-Fi forks](https://github.com/Lu-Fi/open-tx-isp) (branch `next` = integration, `claude/<topic>` = topic branches); tested work reaches `aperto` from `next` after a clean soak.
- Companion repository: [opensensor/openimp](https://github.com/opensensor/openimp) (branch `aperto`). Both repositories are released together; use matching tags.
